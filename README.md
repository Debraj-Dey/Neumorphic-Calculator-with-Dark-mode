# Neumorphic-Calculator-with-Dark-mode

This is a small personal project to implement and learn Neumorphism Styling Concept. This Calculator web application is made to implement Neumorphism Design ans also a Light/Dark Mode Switching option is added.

## What is Neumorphic?
Neumorphic design draws from both skeumorphism and flat design by pairing a monochromatic color palette with subtle shadows that make the calculator's buttons appear tactile. The lowered contrast between foreground and background gives the calculator a soft finish, and the overall effect is a simplified realism.
